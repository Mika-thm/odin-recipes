       <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>This is a very simple dish that is very reminiscent of the fall and winter.  It is warm and comforting.  It is also very calming to make.  Using a whiole squash for this dish is a great expereince ot remind oneslf of the season.  Something about cleaving a large squash open on the kitchen counter feels very involved.  Also scooping out the seeds feels very much like autumn! </p>
    <p>Simmered kabocha is a hearty dish that is great as a side to many other foods.  It is calming and easy to digest. It only requires a couple of ingredients </p>
    <p>it is really a dish that is about waiting and simplicity</p>
