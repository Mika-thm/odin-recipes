    <h1>Pan Fried Mackeral</h1>
    <p>this is a tasty and simple recipe that normally takes me under 15 minutes to put together.  It is filling and one of my favourite seafood dishes.  This dish's simplicity makes it particularly enjoyable. <
    <p>It is great to have if you have rice but don't know what else to eat with it. It also pairs very well with miso soup and grated daikon.  It is nice to have a slice of lemon as well to help cut through the oiliness of the mackeral. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mackeral fillet, better yet learn how to gut/clean a fish so you can have better access to fresh seafood at home</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>daikon</li>
            <li>lemon</li>
            <li>vegatable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>place the mackeral fillets skin side up on a cutting board</li>
            <li>generously salt the skin</li>
            <li>add less pepper than you did salt to the skin</li>
            <li>turn the fillet over and salt and pepper the other side</li>
            <li> drizzle vegatable oil in the pan and turn heat to medium-high</li>

            <li>turn off heat and transfer mackeral to plate</li>
            <li>grate daikon and squeeze out some of the excess water, you can do this too preference</li>

            <li>serve grated daikon and lemon wedge besides mackeral fillets</li>
            <li>side note: ponzu sauce is nice on this dish as well becaue of the citrus in it</li>
